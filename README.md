<h1>âš¡ QuickFlash</h1>
QuickFlash is a modern and minimal flashcard app that enables users to train their memory and track their progress over time. Users can add decks (with cards inside them) and take reviews for each deck. It features a slick user interface and experience that makes using this application a breeze.

## Requirements
QuickFlash runs on Linux/Unix based OS-es with Python, NodeJS (with npm) and Redis installed. This guide assumes that all the requirements are fulfilled.

## Installation
Create the environment variables file **.env**:
```bash
SECRET_KEY="<Your_Secret_Key>"
PORT=80
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///quickflash.sqlite3" # Created automatically
REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379" # Default Redis URL
GMAIL_USERNAME="<Your_Email>@gmail.com" # Access for "Less secure apps" must be enabled for the Google Account
GMAIL_PASSWORD="<Your_Password>"
```
Then,  run the following commands:
```bash
# Start Redis server
